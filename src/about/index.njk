  <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
  <p>I work on practical tools and programs for resilient communities: outdoor education, open hardware, and small‑scale infrastructure. Previously: sensor systems for water, mesh radios for field deployments, and hands‑on STEM curricula. I'm based near Boston.</p>
  <p>Right now I'm building <a href="https://waterbearfieldschool.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waterbear Field School</a> and documenting projects so others can replicate and adapt them.</p>
